# AI Commit (aicmt)

An AI-powered Git commit assistant that not only generates commit messages, but also automatically analyzes and splits your code changes into multiple well-organized commits following best practices.

## Features

- **Intelligent Change Splitting**: Unlike traditional commit message generators, aicmt analyzes your code changes and automatically splits them into logical, focused commits following Git best practices
- **Flexible Control**: You can let AI decide the optimal number of commits, or specify exactly how many commits you want
- **Focus on Coding**: Make all your changes freely, and let AI handle the commit organization - no need to worry about making perfect atomic commits while coding

## Installation

Use pip to install (Python >=3.10)

```bash
pip install aicmt
```
or use brew to install
```bash
brew install versun/tap/aicmt
```

## Quick Start 


1. Create configuration file `.aicmtrc`

Reference the template file [`.aicmtrc.template`](./.aicmtrc.template) and create `.aicmtrc` in your home directory.
```bash
cp .aicmtrc.template ~/.aicmtrc
```
You can also create `.aicmtrc` in the current directory, which will override the global configuration file (~/.aicmtrc)
```bash
cd /path/to/git/repo
touch .aicmtrc
```

2. Add OpenAI API and other information in the configuration file.

3. Enter your git repository directory and run the `aicmt` command to automatically analyze changes and generate commit messages.

## Help
```bash
$ aicmt -h
usage: aicmt [-h] [-v] [-n N]

<<< AICMT (AI Commit) - AI-powered Git commit assistant >>>

options:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  -v, --version        show program's version number and exit
  -n, --num-commits N  Number of commits to generate (default: AI decides)
```

## Development
